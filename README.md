# JSCrashCourseWTMB
This repository contains my project for the JS Crash Course by Women Techmakers Berlin.
I will try to make a tool to look up pieces of information that are needed, when developing a photographic film on your own. In order for the photographic development process to work out as intended, it is necessary to stick to specific proportions of chemicals and fixed corresponding development times. This tool should make it easy to match the correct measurements to the development time needed.
